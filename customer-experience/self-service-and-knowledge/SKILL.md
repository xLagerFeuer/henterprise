# Self-service and knowledge

Good self-service is the cheapest support you will ever run and the most neglected. It is also
frequently the wrong answer — an article explaining a confusing screen is a bandage on a design
problem.

## When to Use

- Building or fixing a help center.
- Reducing support volume.
- Writing documentation for customers.
- Improving findability of existing content.
- Deciding what deserves a help article versus a product fix.

## Procedure

### Decide what deserves an article

Before writing, ask whether the contact should exist. If people repeatedly need instructions for one
screen, the screen is the defect. Documenting it makes the problem permanent and invisible.

Write articles for things that are genuinely complex, genuinely occasional, or genuinely outside
your control. Not for things that are merely badly designed.

### What to write, and in what order

Rank by contact volume, not by feature importance. The most-viewed help content is almost never
what the team expected — it is billing, access, and the one confusing setting.

Structure each article around the customer's task, in their words, not your feature's name. People
search for what they are trying to do.

- **Answer first.** The steps in the first screen, context afterward. Nobody arrives wanting
  background.
- **One task per article.** Combined articles fail search, because the match lands on the wrong half.
- **Show the actual interface** — real labels, real button names, updated when they change.
- **Say what to do when it does not work.** The next step, and how to reach a human. Making that
  hard converts a solvable problem into a complaint about you hiding.

### Findability decides everything

An article nobody finds does not exist. Findability comes from titles matching real search language,
in-product links at the moment of confusion, and search that tolerates the words customers actually
use rather than your internal vocabulary.

Read your help-center search logs, especially the queries returning nothing. That list is your
content backlog, ranked by demand, already written for you.

### In-product beats the help center

Guidance at the point of confusion deflects far more than a help center does, because it requires no
decision to go looking. A well-written empty state, field hint, or error message removes contacts
that documentation never would.

### Maintenance

Documentation rots silently and confidently. Every article needs an owner and a review date, and
anything describing an interface needs checking whenever that interface changes.

## Pitfalls

- Documenting a confusing screen instead of fixing it. That makes the problem permanent and
  invisible.
- Wrong documentation, which is worse than none: it costs the customer time and then a contact
  anyway, and it spends trust.
- Ranking content by feature importance rather than contact volume.
- Combined articles, which fail search because the match lands on the wrong half.
- Hiding the route to a human, which converts a solvable problem into a complaint about you hiding.

## Verification

Measure deflection honestly — contacts avoided, not page views. Approximate it by looking at whether
contact volume for a topic falls after content ships.

Watch articles with high views *and* a high subsequent contact rate. Those are articles that are
failing to answer, and they look like your best-performing content. Report both numbers together, or
the report is flattering rather than useful.
