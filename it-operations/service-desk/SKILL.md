# Service desk

The service desk is where the whole IT organization is judged, usually by people having a bad day.
Most of what makes it good is intake discipline and honest measurement.

## When to Use

- Setting up or fixing a service desk.
- Designing ticket priority and escalation.
- Reducing repeat contacts.
- Structuring a knowledge base.
- Working out why a desk hitting its targets still frustrates everyone.

## Procedure

### Intake determines everything downstream

Capture enough at first contact to route correctly and act without a second exchange: who, what
they were doing, what happened, what they expected, and how blocked they are.

Give the requester a single channel that works. Multiple half-supported channels — a queue, a chat, a
shoulder tap, a manager's direct message — mean the loudest request wins rather than the most urgent,
and the desk's workload becomes unmeasurable because most of it is invisible.

### Priority is impact against urgency

Priority is not a feeling. Define it on two axes — how many people are affected and how blocked they
are — and publish the matrix so it can be applied consistently rather than argued each time.

Keep **incidents** (something broken) separate from **requests** (something wanted). They have
different clocks, different queues, and different success conditions, and merging them lets routine
requests bury outages.

Escalation should be time-based and automatic. Relying on someone to notice a ticket aging means the
tickets that age are the ones nobody is watching.

### Eliminate demand rather than absorbing it

A desk that handles the same failure two hundred times has done two hundred units of work and solved
nothing. Cluster tickets by underlying cause and feed the top few into permanent fixes — a
configuration change, a fix at source, or self-service that genuinely resolves.

Knowledge articles should be written for the person with the problem, not the person who fixed it:
the symptom as experienced, then the steps. An article filed under the internal cause is not
findable by anyone who does not already know the answer.

## Pitfalls

- Running parallel unofficial intake channels and treating the ticket queue as the workload.
- Merging incidents and requests into one queue.
- Targeting individuals on ticket volume. It reliably produces cherry-picking of easy tickets and
  quiet avoidance of hard ones.
- Closing a recurring issue repeatedly without escalating it as a problem to eliminate.
- Relying on someone to notice an aging ticket.
- Filing knowledge articles under the internal cause rather than the experienced symptom.

## Verification

Measure service, not activity. Tickets closed measures activity, and optimizing it produces premature
closure and reopened tickets. Report instead:

- **First-contact resolution** — resolved without a handoff.
- **Time to resolution at the percentile users feel**, not the mean.
- **Reopen rate** — the direct check on premature closure.
- **Repeat contacts for the same underlying cause** — the number that points at problems worth
  eliminating.
