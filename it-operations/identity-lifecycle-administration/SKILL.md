# Identity lifecycle administration

This is execution: creating, changing and removing access as people arrive, move and leave.
**Policy — what a role should be entitled to, and least privilege — belongs to
`enterprise/security/access-and-identity`.** This skill runs the process that policy defines, and the
gap between the two is where most access problems live.

## When to Use

- Setting up or fixing joiner-mover-leaver.
- Deprovisioning someone completely.
- Cleaning up accumulated access.
- Auditing group membership.
- Finding accounts that outlived their owners.

## Procedure

### Joiners

Provision from the role, not by copying a colleague. Copying is the single largest source of
privilege accumulation: it inherits everything that person collected, including access they should
not have had, and it propagates that indefinitely.

Define role-based bundles for the common cases so a standard joiner is one action, and treat
anything outside them as an exception requiring approval. Exceptions are fine; unrecorded exceptions
are not.

Time provisioning to be complete before the start date — coordinated through
`enterprise/people/onboarding-and-offboarding`.

### Movers are the neglected case

Leavers get attention because someone is going. Movers do not, and so access accrues: the person who
has worked in three departments has permissions from all three, and nobody ever removed the first
two.

Treat a role change as a **revoke and re-provision**, not an addition. This is the single
highest-value fix available in most organizations, and it is almost always skipped because the person
is still present and nothing appears broken.

### Leavers, completely

Disable promptly at the agreed time, then work a checklist that reaches past the directory: systems
outside single sign-on, local accounts, shared credentials the person knew, API keys and tokens they
created, external services procured on a personal login, and any mail or calendar delegation.

The gap is almost always the systems identity management does not reach. Maintain the list of them
explicitly rather than discovering it during an audit.

Preserve rather than delete where there is any prospect of investigation or legal hold — deletion is
irreversible and occasionally very expensive.

## Pitfalls

- Provisioning by copying an existing user.
- Adding access on a role change without removing the old.
- Considering a leaver deprovisioned when the directory account is disabled.
- Running recertification where non-response means retain.
- Deleting a leaver's data where investigation or legal hold is possible.

## Verification

Recertify, and act on it. Periodically, system owners confirm who should still have access. This is
worth doing only if non-response defaults to removal; where non-response means retain,
recertification becomes a formality that certifies whatever exists.

Hunt specifically for orphaned accounts — accounts with no owner, service accounts nobody claims,
and credentials that have not been used in months but still work. Report the leaver checklist against
the explicit list of systems outside single sign-on, not against the directory alone.
