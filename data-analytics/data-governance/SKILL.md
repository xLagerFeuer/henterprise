# Data governance

Governance has a reputation for bureaucracy because it is usually implemented as approval queues.
Done properly it is the opposite: it makes data usable without asking anyone.

## When to Use

- Metrics disagree between teams.
- Nobody knows which dataset is authoritative.
- Setting up data ownership or access policy.
- Data quality is unreliable.
- Before opening a dataset to a wider audience.

## Procedure

### Start with definitions, not policy

The highest-value governance artifact is a metric dictionary. For each business metric:

- The **plain-language definition** — what it counts, and what it deliberately excludes.
- The **computation**, unambiguously: source table, filters, time grain, timezone.
- The **owner** — a person who decides when it is disputed.
- **Known caveats** — when it is misleading, and what changed historically.

Most metric disputes dissolve once both parties read the same definition and discover they were
measuring different things. Almost none require a policy.

Watch the ones that look obvious. "Active customer," "revenue," and "signup" each have half a dozen
defensible definitions, and the ambiguity surfaces at the worst moment.

### Ownership

Every dataset has a named owner accountable for its quality and access — a person, not a team.
Unowned datasets decay, and nobody notices until a decision is made on stale data.

The owner should sit with the business meaning, not with the pipeline. The team that generates the
data understands what it means; the platform team understands how it moves.

### Quality, measured rather than asserted

Test data like code, continuously, and alert on failures:

- **Freshness** — did it arrive when expected?
- **Volume** — is the row count within its normal range? A silent drop to zero is the classic
  failure.
- **Uniqueness and nullity** on key fields.
- **Referential integrity** across joins.
- **Distribution** — has the shape shifted in a way nothing explains?

The point is finding breakage before a decision is made on it. A pipeline that fails loudly is
better than one that silently produces yesterday's numbers.

### Access

Default to open for internal, non-personal data. Restrictive-by-default drives the shadow spreadsheet
layer, which is genuinely less safe than a governed warehouse.

Personal, financial, and regulated data are the exception: least privilege, purpose stated, reviewed
periodically, with Legal & Risk involved on anything with a lawful-basis question.

### Lineage

Know where a number came from and what feeds it. Without lineage, you cannot answer the two
questions that matter during an incident: what broke upstream, and what downstream is now wrong.

## Pitfalls

- Letting two systems each claim to be the source of truth for the same fact.
- Fixing a data-quality issue in a dashboard. Fix it upstream or it recurs in every other consumer.
- Retiring a dataset because it looks unused — you cannot see every consumer. Deprecate, announce,
  then remove.
- Restrictive-by-default access, which drives the shadow spreadsheet layer.
- Implementing governance as an approval queue.

## Verification

The governed state is checkable: every business metric has a dictionary entry with definition,
computation, owner, and caveats; every dataset has a named person accountable; quality assertions
run continuously and alert; lineage answers what broke upstream and what is now wrong downstream.
Report which of these exist and which are asserted rather than measured.
