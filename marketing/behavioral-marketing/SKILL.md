# Behavioral marketing

People do not evaluate offers on merit and then act. They decide fast, under uncertainty, using
whatever the context makes salient — and then explain the decision afterward. Marketing that assumes
otherwise loses to marketing that does not.

## When to Use

- A well-argued offer is not converting.
- Structuring choices, or presenting pricing.
- Designing an experience around how attention and memory work.
- Pressure-testing whether a persuasion tactic is legitimate or manipulative.

## Procedure

### The effects that most often explain a stuck conversion

**Reference dependence.** Nothing is judged absolutely. A price is high or low relative to whatever
was shown first, so what you present first sets the frame for everything after it.

**Loss aversion.** Losing something registers considerably more than gaining the equivalent. This is
why switching costs are underestimated by sellers and overestimated by buyers, and why "what you are
currently losing" often outperforms "what you could gain."

**Choice overload.** More options reduce the likelihood of any choice being made. Beyond a small
number, each additional option raises the cost of deciding faster than it raises the chance of a
good match. If a pricing page has seven tiers, the problem is not the copy.

**Status quo and default effects.** Doing nothing is the most-chosen option in almost every context,
and whatever is pre-selected is disproportionately taken. Whether a default exists is often a bigger
lever than anything in the argument around it.

**Social proof.** Evidence of what similar others did carries more weight than claims about quality —
and specificity matters. "Used by four hundred logistics teams" works where "trusted by thousands"
does not, because the first is checkable and names a peer group.

**Zero-price effect.** Free is not a very low price; it is a different category that suspends
cost-benefit reasoning. This makes free tiers powerful acquisition tools and dangerous pricing
anchors.

**Present bias.** Immediate costs and benefits are weighted far above future ones. An annual plan
competes against a monthly one on the immediacy of the charge, not on total value.

**Goal-gradient and endowed progress.** Effort increases as a visible goal approaches, and progress
already granted counts. Progress indicators work; starting someone partway along works better.

**Peak-end.** An experience is remembered by its most intense moment and its ending, not its average.
The last screen of onboarding and the cancellation flow carry disproportionate memory weight.

### Using this without becoming manipulative

Every effect above can be used to help someone decide well or to extract a decision they would
regret. The distinction is not subtle, and it is testable:

- **Would the customer be comfortable if you explained the technique to them?** Anchoring against a
  real higher-value plan passes. A fake original price does not.
- **Does it help them decide, or prevent them deciding?** Reducing choice overload helps. A countdown
  that resets on refresh does not.
- **Does it survive a satisfied customer?** Tactics that work only until the person notices produce
  churn, chargebacks, and in several jurisdictions regulatory exposure — dark patterns around
  cancellation and consent are now specifically enforced.

Scarcity and urgency deserve particular caution: legitimate when real and stated precisely, corrosive
when manufactured. A false constraint is the single fastest way to lose a customer who was going to
buy anyway.

### Reasoning about it

- **Look for the constraint, not the list.** One thing usually blocks the decision. Applying six
  techniques to a page with an unclear value proposition addresses none of them.
- **Second-order effects.** A tactic that raises conversion and raises refunds has not worked. Judge
  against downstream behavior, not the immediate step.

## Pitfalls

- Applying six techniques at once to a page whose value proposition is unclear.
- Manufactured scarcity or urgency. A false constraint is the fastest way to lose a customer who was
  going to buy anyway.
- Treating published effect sizes as predictions. They are directional, and this is where behavioral
  marketing most often overreaches.
- Judging a tactic on the immediate step rather than on downstream behavior.
- Any technique you would not be comfortable explaining to the customer.

## Verification

Treat every application as a hypothesis to test rather than a known quantity — effects are contextual
and they interact. Measure against downstream behavior: refunds, cancellations, and retention, not
just the conversion step. Run each tactic through the three tests above — explainable, decision-
helping, survives a satisfied customer — and report the answer for the ones you kept.
