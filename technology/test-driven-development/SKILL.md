# Test-driven development

## When to Use

- Before writing implementation code for any feature or bugfix.
- A bug needs a regression test.
- Existing code is hard to change safely.
- Someone asks whether a change is covered.
- Deciding what is worth testing and what is not.

## Procedure

### The loop

1. **Red** — write one test that fails for the right reason. Run it. A test that passes immediately
   is testing nothing; a test that errors instead of failing is testing the wrong thing.
2. **Green** — the smallest change that makes it pass. Ugly is fine here.
3. **Refactor** — clean up with the test green. If it goes red, you changed behavior, not structure.

Never skip step 1. Writing the test after the code produces a test shaped to the implementation,
which is the one shape that cannot catch the implementation being wrong.

### What to test

Test behavior at the boundary a caller actually depends on. For each unit ask: if this broke
silently, who notices and how? If the answer is nobody, delete the code rather than test it.

- **Test**: branching logic, boundary conditions, error paths, anything with a past bug, contracts
  between modules.
- **Do not test**: getters, framework behavior, private helpers reachable only through a public path
  already covered, exact wording of log lines.

### Bugs

Every bug gets a failing test *before* the fix, reproducing it at the smallest scope that shows it.
That test is the proof the bug existed and the guard that it stays fixed. A fix without one is a
claim.

## Pitfalls

- Skipping red. A test written after the code is shaped to the implementation, which is the one
  shape that cannot catch it being wrong.
- More than one behavior per test. A test asserting five things tells you almost nothing when it
  fails.
- A test name that states the method rather than the behavior: `test_auth` instead of
  `rejects_expired_token`.
- Weakening an assertion to get green. If a test is inconvenient, the design is telling you
  something.
- Mocking what you own. Mock the network and the clock, not your own modules — mocking your own code
  tests the mock.
- Fixing a bug without a failing test first, which makes the fix a claim.

## Verification

Report the tests added, what each pins down, what is deliberately untested and why, and the actual
command you ran with its output. "Tests pass" without the command output is not a result.
