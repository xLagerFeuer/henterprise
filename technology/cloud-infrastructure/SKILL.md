# Cloud infrastructure

Cloud replaces capital cost with an operating cost that scales with carelessness. The discipline is
mostly about making the environment reproducible and the spend visible.

## When to Use

- Designing a cloud environment.
- Controlling infrastructure spend.
- Setting up environment separation.
- Planning for scale or region failure.
- Reviewing infrastructure someone configured by hand.

## Procedure

### Everything reproducible from code

Infrastructure created by hand cannot be reviewed, reproduced, or recovered. Define it as code,
review it like code, and apply it through a pipeline rather than from a laptop.

Console access for humans should be read-only in production by default. Write access exists for
emergencies, is time-bound, and is logged — see `enterprise/security/access-and-identity` for the
policy this implements.

### Environments that mean something

Separate environments by blast radius, not by name. Separate accounts or subscriptions give a hard
boundary; separate namespaces in one account give a soft one that a misconfigured permission
crosses.

Production data does not belong in lower environments. Where realistic data is needed, mask or
synthesize it — a copied production database is a breach waiting for a misconfigured bucket, and it
is one of the most common ways personal data escapes.

### Networking and isolation

Default deny, then open what is needed. Public exposure should be a deliberate, reviewable act rather
than the residue of a default.

Keep the trust boundary explicit and few: what is reachable from the internet, what is reachable
between services, what reaches data stores. Most cloud incidents are not exotic — they are a storage
bucket, a database, or a management interface that was reachable and should not have been.

### Scaling and failure

Scale horizontally where you can and know your actual limits — the database connection ceiling, the
third-party rate limit, the single-threaded component nobody remembers. Autoscaling in front of a
hard downstream limit converts a slow system into an outage.

Design for the failure of a single instance and a single zone as routine. Region failure is a
business continuity decision with a real price attached, made with
`enterprise/operations/business-continuity-and-resilience` rather than assumed by engineering.

### Cost

Cost is an architectural property. Attribute spend by team and workload from the start; without
tagging, cost becomes an unattributable aggregate that only ever gets addressed in a panic.

The usual large wins are unglamorous: idle non-production resources, over-provisioned instances,
storage nobody deleted, and cross-zone data transfer nobody accounted for.

## Pitfalls

- Making a production change by hand that is not reflected in code.
- Putting production data in a lower environment unmasked.
- Autoscaling a tier in front of a hard downstream limit.
- Running without cost attribution until the bill forces it.
- Separating environments by namespace where a misconfigured permission crosses the boundary.
- Public exposure as the residue of a default rather than a deliberate act.

## Verification

The test of reproducibility: could you rebuild the environment from an empty account, and do you
know that because you have done it? Untested reproducibility is a belief.

Report the trust boundaries explicitly — what is reachable from the internet, between services, and
to data stores — and confirm each by test rather than by reading the configuration. Report cost
attributed by team and workload; an unattributable aggregate is not a cost report.
