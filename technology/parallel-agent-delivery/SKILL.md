# Parallel agent delivery

Parallelism is a property of the work, not a preference. Establish it before dispatching.

## When to Use

- Several independent tasks with no shared state.
- A plan has parallelizable steps.
- A broad search or audit would be faster fanned out.
- Deciding whether work can safely be split at all.

## Prerequisites

All three must hold, or run sequentially:

1. **Disjoint write surfaces** — no two agents touch the same file. Not "unlikely to conflict";
   provably disjoint.
2. **No sequential dependency** — none needs another's output to start.
3. **Independently verifiable** — each result can be judged on its own.

Two agents editing one file produces a merge conflict at best and a silent lost update at worst.

## Procedure

### Dispatching

Each agent gets a self-contained brief: the goal, its exclusive surface, the context it cannot see
for itself, and the shape of the answer expected. Agents share no memory — anything you leave out is
gone.

Ask for a **structured return**, the same shape from each, so results can be compared rather than
re-read. At minimum return `status`, `artifacts`, `decisions`, `new_dependencies`, and
`verification`.

On Hermes, make the split executable with the native `delegate_task` tool. Create one child task per
operational unit and use a batch only for rows that satisfy all three prerequisites above. Before the
call, keep a compact coordination table in the orchestrator context:

| task | child remit | write surface | depends on | shared contract | state |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ready / blocked / done |

The orchestrator owns this table. Delegated children get fresh conversations, so do not assume one
child can see another child's decisions. Put every shared API, data, timing, or handoff contract that
a child needs into its brief.

If a returned result changes a shared contract or exposes a new dependency, do not let an affected
child continue against stale assumptions. Mark that work blocked, reconcile the contract in the
orchestrator, and dispatch or re-dispatch the affected child with the revised contract. If two write
surfaces cease to be disjoint, serialize them instead of hoping the merge will work.

For durable cross-team commitments rather than task-local parallel work, use
`enterprise/pmo/dependency-and-risk-management`; this skill owns the execution-time coordination of
the delegated child agents.

### Read-only fan-out is the easy case

Searching, auditing, and reviewing have no write surface at all, so they parallelize without risk.
Reach for parallelism here first and freely.

### Integrating

- Review each result against its brief before merging any of them.
- Update the coordination table from every returned `new_dependencies` or contract change before
  launching dependent work.
- Where two disagree on a shared fact, neither is authoritative — resolve it in the orchestrator and
  return the resolved contract to the affected child or children.
- One agent returning nothing useful is a normal outcome, not a failure to retry blindly.

## Pitfalls

- Splitting work to look faster when the steps are actually sequential.
- Letting two agents write to one surface because "they probably won't collide."
- Treating `delegate_task` as routing only; the orchestrator still has to regulate dependency and
  shared-contract conflicts between children.
- Merging a result you have not read.
- A brief that assumes shared context. Agents share no memory; anything left out is gone.
- Unstructured returns, which have to be re-read rather than compared.
- Retrying an empty result blindly rather than treating it as an outcome.

## Verification

Prove the three preconditions before dispatch, in writing — especially disjointness, which is the one
people assert rather than check. Record which rows were batched and which were serialized. Then
review each returned result against its own brief, update the coordination table with any new
contract/dependency information, and show that affected children received the revised contract
before they resumed or were re-dispatched. A batch merged together hides which agent's result was
wrong.
