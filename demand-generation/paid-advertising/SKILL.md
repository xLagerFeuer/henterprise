# Paid advertising

Paid is the fastest way to buy a result and the fastest way to buy nothing. The difference is
mostly discipline before launch.

## When to Use

- Setting up or restructuring campaigns.
- Writing and iterating ad creative.
- Diagnosing rising costs or falling performance.
- Deciding budget allocation.
- Judging whether a channel is working.

## Procedure

### Before spending

- **Know the ceiling.** Maximum acceptable acquisition cost, derived from margin and payback period,
  not from what feels affordable.
- **Conversion tracking verified end to end**, with a test conversion confirmed in the platform.
  Optimizing against broken tracking teaches the algorithm the wrong thing, and that damage
  persists.
- **The destination is ready.** Paid traffic to a page that does not convert is a donation. Fix the
  page first — it is cheaper.

### Structure

Structure follows intent, since intent determines what a click is worth.

- **Search** — separate by intent tier: brand, high-intent problem terms, category terms, broad
  research. Never one budget across all four; the broad terms will consume it.
- **Social** — structure by audience, since creative fatigue and audience saturation are the two
  variables and you need to see them separately.
- Enough volume per campaign to exit the learning phase. Over-segmentation starves every campaign of
  the data it needs.

### Naming conventions

Decide the convention before the first campaign, because renaming later breaks historical reporting
on every platform.

A workable pattern encodes, in fixed order: channel, objective, audience or intent tier, geography,
and creative theme — separated consistently, with no spaces. It should be possible to filter a
report by any one of those segments without opening a campaign.

Apply it to every level: campaign, ad set, and ad. Inconsistent naming is why cross-channel
reporting takes a week to assemble and why nobody trusts it when it arrives.

### Creative

Creative is the biggest lever on paid social and the most neglected.

- Test genuinely different **angles**, not variations of one. Five headlines around one idea is one
  test.
- The first frame or line does the work. Assume the rest is not seen.
- Match the ad's promise to the landing page exactly. Mismatch shows up as a bounce you will
  misdiagnose as a targeting problem.
- Expect fatigue and plan refreshes on a schedule; rising cost with flat conversion rate is usually
  fatigue, not competition.

## Pitfalls

- Scaling a campaign on a few conversions. Wait for significance.
- Changing several variables in one edit.
- Letting a channel run without a stated read-by date and a kill threshold.
- One budget across all four search intent tiers — the broad terms will consume it.
- Over-segmentation, which starves every campaign of the data it needs.
- Sending paid traffic to a page that does not convert.
- Naming campaigns inconsistently, which makes cross-channel reporting untrustworthy.

## Verification

Diagnose in sequence: impressions (is it serving), click-through (is the creative landing),
conversion rate (is the page delivering), cost per acquisition (is it economic), and downstream
quality (did those customers stay). Stopping at cost per acquisition is how channels get scaled that
are buying bad customers cheaply.

Confirm a test conversion arrives in the platform before spending, and report acquisition cost
against the ceiling derived from margin and payback — not against what feels affordable.
