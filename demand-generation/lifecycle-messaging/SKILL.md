# Lifecycle messaging

Automated email and SMS: what a person should receive at each stage, when, and on what consent.

## When to Use

- Building or fixing an email sequence.
- Planning lifecycle automation.
- Improving open or click performance.
- Setting up SMS flows.
- Deciding what messages a customer should receive and when.

## Procedure

### Map the lifecycle before writing any message

For each stage, name what the person is trying to do and what would move them forward. Messages
written without that answer become announcements, and announcements get unsubscribed from.

The stages that matter: just signed up, activated but not habitual, habitual, at risk, lapsed.
Most programs over-invest in the first and neglect at-risk entirely, which is where the money is.

### The welcome sequence

The highest-engagement messages you will ever send. Do not waste them on company history.

1. **Immediate** — deliver whatever was promised, plus the single next action.
2. **Within days** — the fastest route to first value, one step.
3. **After that** — the use case most people miss, or the objection most people have.

Set expectations early: what you send, how often. It reduces unsubscribes more than any subject-line
technique.

### Timing and cadence

Trigger on behavior, not the calendar, wherever possible. A message sent because someone did
something is many times more relevant than one sent because it is Tuesday.

Cadence sustainable at your worst week. Every message should be one the recipient would miss.

### SMS is a different medium

Higher consent bar, higher intrusion, higher cost. Reserve it for time-sensitive and transactional
messages — delivery, appointment, security, an expiring window. Marketing SMS at any volume trains
people to opt out.

Explicit opt-in, honored opt-out, sending hours respected in the recipient's timezone. These are
legal requirements in most jurisdictions, not preferences.

### SMS compliance is not optional

> Consult qualified counsel before launching an SMS program. The exposure here is statutory damages
> per message, which is how these become class actions.

In the US, marketing SMS requires **express written consent** obtained before sending — implied
consent, an existing customer relationship, or a phone number collected for another purpose does not
qualify. The consent record must show what the person agreed to receive and when, and it must be
retained.

The operational requirements that follow:

- Disclose program purpose, frequency, and that message rates may apply, at the point of consent.
- Honor opt-out immediately, on every standard keyword, with a single confirmation message and
  nothing after it.
- Respect quiet hours in the **recipient's** timezone, not yours.
- Keep consent and opt-out records for as long as the retention rules require — these records are
  the entire defense if challenged.
- Never buy or rent SMS lists. Purchased consent is not consent.

Other jurisdictions impose their own rules, and several are stricter. Determine which apply by where
recipients are, not where you are.

### Subject lines and preview text

They are one unit and get read together. A subject line that works with the preview repeating it
wastes the second-most-read text in the message — use the preview to extend the subject, not echo
it, and never leave it to default to the first line of the body.

## Pitfalls

- Sending to a list that did not opt in.
- Burying the unsubscribe.
- Running a re-engagement program without a plan to actually remove the people who do not re-engage.
  An unengaged list damages delivery for everyone else.
- Marketing SMS at volume, which trains people to opt out.
- Treating an existing customer relationship, or a number collected for another purpose, as consent.
- Sending on the calendar where a behavioral trigger was available.
- Over-investing in welcome and neglecting at-risk, which is where the money is.

## Verification

Diagnose in this order, because the fixes are unrelated:

- **Low open** — subject line, sender reputation, or list quality. Check deliverability before
  rewriting subject lines; a reputation problem looks exactly like a copy problem.
- **Open but no click** — the message did not deliver on the subject, or has no single clear action.
- **Click but no conversion** — the destination, not the email.
- **Rising unsubscribes** — frequency or relevance. Usually frequency.

For SMS, verify the consent record shows what each person agreed to and when, that opt-out is honored
on every standard keyword with a single confirmation, and that quiet hours resolve in the recipient's
timezone.
