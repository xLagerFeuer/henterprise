# Activation

Acquisition spend is wasted downstream of a weak activation. This is usually the cheapest place to
improve revenue and the least worked on.

## When to Use

- Designing or fixing signup and onboarding.
- Diagnosing why signups do not convert to active use.
- Reducing time-to-value.
- Deciding what a new user must accomplish first.

## Procedure

### Define the activation moment

Name the specific thing a new user does that predicts they will stay — not "logged in twice," but
the action that delivers the value they came for. Find it in the data: compare what retained users
did in week one against what churned users did.

Everything in onboarding exists to get people to that moment faster. Without it defined, onboarding
becomes a feature tour.

### Signup

Every field costs conversion, and each one must earn its place. Ask for what is needed to deliver
value now; collect the rest later, in context, when the reason is obvious.

- Defer email verification past first value where the product allows it.
- Never ask for payment details before value is delivered unless the model requires it.
- Show progress on multi-step flows, and let people finish later without losing work.
- Errors inline and specific. A form that rejects on submit without saying which field is where
  people leave.

### Onboarding

The goal is the first real outcome, not a completed tour.

- **Use their data, not sample data.** The moment someone sees their own information in the product
  is the moment it becomes real.
- **One action at a time**, each visibly advancing toward the outcome.
- **Skippable, resumable, and repeatable.** Forced linear onboarding fails everyone whose situation
  differs from the assumed one.
- **Empty states do the teaching.** They are the most-seen screens in a new account and usually the
  least designed.

Checklists work when the items lead to real value and the list can be dismissed. They fail when they
are busywork.

### Diagnosing

Instrument each step and find the largest drop. Then watch session recordings of people who dropped
there — the quantitative data says where, and only observation says why.

Common causes, in rough order: asked for too much too early, value not visible before effort
required, an empty product with no path out of it, and a required integration nobody has permissions
for.

## Pitfalls

- Onboarding with no activation moment defined, which becomes a feature tour.
- Sample data instead of the user's own.
- Forced linear onboarding, which fails everyone whose situation differs from the assumed one.
- Undesigned empty states — the most-seen screens in a new account.
- Asking for payment details before value is delivered.
- Reading the funnel without watching sessions.

## Verification

Measure the percentage reaching the activation moment, and the time to reach it. Signup conversion
alone will happily improve while activation falls — report both or the number is flattering.
