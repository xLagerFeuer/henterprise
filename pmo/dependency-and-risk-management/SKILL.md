# Dependency and risk management

This is delivery risk: what could prevent this work from landing. Enterprise risk — the framework,
appetite and register at company level — is `enterprise/legal-risk/enterprise-risk`, and the two
should not be merged.

## When to Use

- Building a risk register that gets used.
- Managing dependencies between teams.
- Deciding what to escalate and when.
- Working out why the same risks keep materialising unmanaged.

## Procedure

### Dependencies are commitments or they are wishes

A dependency in your plan that the owning team has not agreed to, with a date they have committed
to, is a wish. Most plans contain several.

For each: what exactly is needed, from whom by name, by when, and what happens if it is late. Then
confirm it with the owning team in a way they would recognize as a commitment — an item on their
plan, not a mention in a meeting.

Track dependencies both ways. Teams reliably track what they are owed and forget what they owe, which
is why everyone believes they are being let down.

The dangerous ones are **transitive**: your dependency has a dependency you cannot see. Trace at
least one hop further than feels necessary, particularly where a shared specialist or a single team
appears repeatedly.

### A risk register people actually use

Most registers are written once for a gate and never opened. What makes one useful:

- **Specific.** "Integration delay" is a topic. "Vendor's API v2 is not released until March; our
  migration starts in February" is a risk you can act on.
- **Sized on both axes** — likelihood and impact — because the response differs entirely between a
  likely nuisance and an unlikely catastrophe.
- **Owned by someone who can act**, not by the project manager who can only report.
- **Carrying a decision date** — the point past which mitigation is no longer possible. This is the
  field most often omitted and the one that makes the register operational rather than decorative.

Review by exception: what changed, what is approaching its decision date. Reading the whole register
aloud is how registers stop being read.

### Mitigate, or accept explicitly

Four responses: avoid by changing the plan, reduce likelihood or impact, transfer to someone better
placed to carry it, or accept. Acceptance is legitimate and must be explicit, with a named accepter
— an unacknowledged acceptance is just an unmanaged risk.

Distinguish mitigation from contingency. Mitigation lowers the chance; contingency is what you do
when it happens anyway. Serious risks need both, and contingency needs to be prepared before it is
required.

## Pitfalls

- Carrying a dependency the owning team has not committed to.
- Logging a risk without an owner who can act on it.
- Accepting a risk without naming who accepted it.
- Escalating a concern without naming the decision required.
- Omitting the decision date, which is what makes a register operational.
- Tracking only what you are owed and not what you owe.

## Verification

Escalate early and specifically. An escalation naming the decision needed, the options, and the date
by which it is needed gets resolved. A general expression of concern gets acknowledged and nothing
happens.

Escalate when the decision exceeds your authority or the decision date is approaching — not when the
risk has already materialised, at which point it is a status report. Test the register by checking
every entry has an owner who can act and a decision date that has not silently passed.
